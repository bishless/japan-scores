# Let's go to Japan Scores

_Not actually working, yet!_

Uh, goals and stuff. 
Treating each player column on the scrore sheet as a separate form w/ number inputs in a table. Guessing JavaScript will be necessary for the calculations (on keyUp events, maybe?)

## Todos

1. MVP should calc scores w/o looking pretty.
1. If possible, I'd like to avoid a build step... it'd be great to pull this off using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.
1. Ideally, the priority should be on making it work conveniently on small screens.
1. Better be accessible (color contrast, test w/ VoiceOver, etc.)
1. Add explicit privacy statement - clarify that data entered is just calculated client-side. No data is being submitted anywhere or tracked.
1. Uh, handling negative numbers in the Mood track?
1. ...
1. Eventually, we should make it look similar to the paper book. (Try to use some of their iconography if we can)
1. ...
